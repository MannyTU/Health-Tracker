The Java program allows users to input information such as name, age, height, and weight, and then calculates the person’s BMI. Based on the BMI, it determines whether the individual is in a healthy weight range. The key concept here is encapsulation, which ensures that data related to a person’s measurements is kept in a separate class, while their personal details and BMI-related logic are handled in another class. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how classes can interact with each other and how data is managed within an object-oriented structure.
